Coefficient list for exfoliator
Boundary - the position Z moves to without checking force. Too low and the device will move slower, but too high will result in a crash and total failure
Tolerance - how close to the desired force is acceptable. IKA lists the error as 0.3%+2g
Taresleep - positive float, how long to wait for the scale to settle after taring
XYZVel - positive float, sets the stage velocities each time the coeffs are reloaded. Superseded by Approach and Force velocities. Max 12.5 mm/s
Approach Vel - how quickly the stage moves after reaching the boundary and before making contact. Higher values move faster, result in larger initial contact force
Contact Backoff - how far the stage backs off after initial contact to try to have zero applied force before taring
Force Vel - how quickly the stage moves after making contact while trying to reach a set force. Lower values should be more accurate
Stable Time - how long to wait between movements when trying to reach a set force, to allow the scale to equilibrate
Max Step: |Z-Step|<Intercept+|Diff/Slope|, where Diff is the difference between current and target force. Larger intercepts and smaller slopes move more quickly but are more susceptible to overshoot
Derivative Offset: A 'fudge factor' on the calculated spring constant. Larger values move slower but help prevent overshoot.
